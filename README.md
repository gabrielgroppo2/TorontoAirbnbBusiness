<h1>Toronto Airbnb Business</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project utilizes Airbnb data from the city of Toronto, ON, Canada, to find the best neighbourhood in town for starting an Airbnb business. Using SQL for data cleaning and exploration and Tableau to create a dashboard that compares neighbourhoods based on Yearly Revenue, Occupancy Rates, Prices per night and Competition.
<br />

<h2>Criteria for a Good Neighborhood for an Airbnb</h2>

- **Occupancy rate higher than the average** - property is occupied more than half the year.
- **Higher median yearly revenue** -  better chance of earning above average income.
- **Less competition** - fewer listings in the area, easier to stand out.
